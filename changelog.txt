[B]Version: 0.1.2[/B]
*Improved CDN Recognition. CDN1 and CDN2 are now supported.
Known Problems:
*There's currently no checking if CDN's are working.  The plugin simply loads the preferred CDN if it's found.  Toggling the preffered CDN setting may solve problems if a CDN is not working.
*Only two resolutions are supported. (Typically 720p and 480p) Need to find a graceful way to allow greater selection.
[B]Version: 0.1.1[/B]
*Errors relating to no internet connection are now caught.
[B]Version: 0.1.0[/B]
*Greatly Increased Speed of live checking. Labels now persist when removing favorites.
Known Problems:
*CDN1 is the only currently supported CDN. Streams without CDN1 will fail to load.
[B]Version: 0.0.1[/B]
*Initial Release.
Known Problems:
*Live/Offline labels dissapear when deleting a user from favorites. Return to the main menu and reload favorites to refresh status.
